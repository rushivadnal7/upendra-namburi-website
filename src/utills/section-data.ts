The traditional busi,ness model for banks has been that of collecting low-cost retail deposits and lending them at much higher rates. The rates o,ffered are a function of the administrative and risk-related costs associated with the customer and his funding requirements.`,

Charting unfamiliar territory is the norm and rarely the exception these days. The challenge is even greater for professionals who have assumed new roles or have come in from other organizations, in weaving their way through hierarchical layers and departmental silos looking for value collaborators. In large- matrixed organizations the challenge gets exponential in nature.",

Outbound telecalling, perhaps to the chagrin of some of us, has been a significant driver of new customer acquisition and revenues exceeding billions of dollars annually. But with the consumer privacy movement gaining momentum and more regulatory measures likely to make unsolicited customer contact even tougher, marketers need to reinvent their search for that ever-elusive customer sale!`,

  <strong class='text-xl text-neutral-500 font-semibold'>For Ravi Shastry, March is make-or-break.</strong>
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  As a sharp, no-nonsense executive at Imperial Bank, he’s spent years clawing his way to the top. Now, with just 31 days left in the financial year, a promotion is within reach. His boss respects him. His team fears him. His wife believes in him. He’s built his empire one deal at a time, and nothing can shake it.
</p>
<br/>

<p class='font-semibold'>Until the first cracks appear.</p>
<br/>

<p>
  Within days, the bank’s Brazil operations implode. The US arm is in freefall. Global restructuring is coming, and India is next on the chopping block—with Ravi and his team in the firing line.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  Then the knives come out. A former lover-turned-rival wants him crushed. A cunning HR manager is playing puppet master. Internal Audit is circling like a shark. Even his personal life is unraveling.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  By the time Ravi realizes he’s in a war for his survival, it may already be too late. Enemies are closing in. Loyalties are shifting. And the real threat? It’s been right in front of him all along.
</p>
<br/>

<p class='italic font-medium'>
  Will Ravi still have a job when March ends—or will this be his final quarter?
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  <strong>31</strong> is a relentless corporate thriller that drags you into a world where power is fleeting, betrayal is currency, and survival is never guaranteed. Tick-tock, Ravi. Your time is running out.

  Agastya, a ruthless Chief Marketing Officer at one of the biggest FMCG companies, is about to launch the most important product of his career. He’s worked for this moment his entire life. Then, in a matter of minutes, everything starts to collapse. The deal. His job. Even his marriage. He has 60 minutes to stop the fallout—or lose everything.
</p>

<p>
  Maithili, brilliant and beautiful, has always played fair in love. But when Agastya pushes her to the edge, she’s done being the victim. Now it’s her turn to strike back. 60 minutes is all she needs to turn his world upside down.
</p>

<p>
  Sailesh, a quiet academic misfit in a world of boardroom sharks, has never been one for corporate warfare. But when someone crosses the line, he’s left with no choice. 60 minutes. One chance. Total annihilation.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  Careers are on the line. Marriages are crumbling. Reputations are in freefall. As the clock ticks down, who will outmaneuver, who will collapse, and who will walk away victorious?

<p>
  Aratrika Reddy, the bold and brilliant CEO of ARYA Holdings Ltd., has just 8 hours to stop her company from crumbling into bankruptcy and betrayal. Her father’s once-mighty multi-billion-dollar empire—spanning hotels, steel, and liquor—is now the ultimate prize in a ruthless corporate war.
</p>
<br/>

<p class='font-semibold'>The vultures are circling.</p>

<p>
  Her estranged husband, Siddhartha, armed with inside knowledge, is playing his trump card. The Rathores, her family’s oldest rivals, are hungry for payback. Her uncle Jagannath, the ultimate manipulator, is working both sides. Her father, Madhusudhan Reddy, a liquor baron with a thirst for power, is pulling strings from the shadows. And overseeing it all? Peter, her old flame—watching, waiting, calculating.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  Lawyers. Politicians. Bankers. Power brokers. Family traitors.
</p>
<br/>

<p>
  As the clock ticks down, Aratrika must navigate a web of deception and ambition, outplay those who want to see her fall, and prove that she is the rightful heir to the empire.

<p class='italic font-medium'>It’s a war. It’s personal. And she’s got just 8 hours to win it.</p>
